The solution involves using optional chaining and nullish coalescing to safely access properties. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
const UserComponent = ({ user }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user?.name ?? 'Guest'}</Text> 
    </View>
  );
};
```
This improved version uses the optional chaining operator (`?.`) to check if `user` is null or undefined before accessing the `name` property. If `user` is null or undefined, the expression short-circuits, and the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) provides a default value of 'Guest'. This prevents the error and provides a user-friendly fallback.

This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This is a common error in JavaScript, and it can be difficult to debug because the error message is not always clear. In React Native, this error can occur when you are working with data from an API or from a database.  For example, if you have a component that displays the name of a user, and the user object is null, you will get this error.  Here's an example:

```javascript
const UserComponent = ({ user }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> // Error if user is null
    </View>
  );
};
```
This would throw an error if `user` is null or undefined because you cannot access the `name` property of a null or undefined object.
